as usual we offer two modes of installation:

1) standalone:
- install choosing the option "Use a File Installation Key" and supply the following FIK
	58691-35070-25550-28046-23042
- select the products you would like to install
- after the installation finishes copy the folders %crackdir%\{bin,java,toolbox} to %installdir% overwriting the originally installed files
- the installer does not create shortcuts or program groups, so you will have to manually create them or just start matlab via
	%installdir%\bin\matlab.exe
	(on first run the activation assistant will pop up, choose "activate without internet" and point to the license file %crackdir%\lic_standalone.dat)

2) floating license (network license server):
- install choosing the option "Use a File Installation Key" and supply the following FIK
	48344-28329-61387-36957-44648
- select the products you would like to install (be sure to select the license manager!)
- when asked for license file point the installer to the file %crackdir%\lic_server.dat
- after the installation finishes copy the folders %crackdir%\{bin,etc,java,toolbox} to %installdir% overwriting the originally installed files
	(make sure the license server isn't running yet !)
- start the license server via lmtool or by cmd-line
